# spring-initial-demo
In this small project I'm using Spring (Boot, Security, MVC, ...) and Unit/Integration tests. The idea is to have an example as start point to other projects

  - Security
  - Test Security

- Database - localhost:8080/h2, to access H2 InMemory DB
  - UserName - sa
  - Password - blank
  
- Documentation - http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
  
- Spring Security
  - login: user
    
- Dependencies
  - Swagger
  - Spring HATEOAS
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Security
  - H2 Database
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Lombok
  - Jackson (Group ID: com.fasterxml.jackson.core, Artifact ID: jackson-databind)

- Git Local Configuration
  - Open Terminal.
  - Change the current working directory to the local repository where you want to configure the email address that you associate with your Git commits.
  - Set an email address in Git. You can use your GitHub-provided no-reply email address or any email address.
    $ git config user.email "email@example.com"
  - Confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git:
    $ git config user.email
    email@example.com
