# spring-initial-demo
In this small project I'm using Spring (Boot, Security, MVC, ...) and Unit/Integration tests. The idea is to have an example as start point to other projects

- TODO
  - Swagger
  - Profile
  - Security
  - Test Security

- localhost:8080/h2, to access H2 InMemory DB
  - UserName - sa
  - Password - blank
  
- Spring Security
  - login: user
    
- Dependencies
  - Spring HATEOAS
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Security
  - H2 Database
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Lombok
  - Jackson (Group ID: com.fasterxml.jackson.core, Artifact ID: jackson-databind)
